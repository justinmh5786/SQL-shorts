Quick bites at the SQL apple
Attempting to learn SQL has shown many routes. There are multiple programs through Coursera, Khan Academy, DataCamp (just to name a few - I could keep naming a few more but these are the classes I have looked at). I began this SQL journey because I just wanted to learn something completely different. My work experiences are in management and project managagement. I had no experience in any kind of coding, relational databases or anything related to computer science so I wanted to learn something new. The purpose of this blog is to provide bite sized snippets of learning to use SQL as a supplement to anyone also sharing a similar journey - including what I found to be enlightening coming from a complete noob. Writing and explaining information also helps me to process the information. For better or for worse - welcome!
